      <p>
          During the project, we had a lot of problems, and thanks to the help of these teachers, so that we can successfully complete our project.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Prof. Xinkui Wang</strong><br>
          We decided to use AuNPs to verify whether the aptamer binds to kanamycin, so we asked Prof. Wang for help on how to prepare AuNPs and improving our experimental protocol.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Prof. Mahinur Akkaya</strong><br>
          The preparation of the circular template is the most important part of our experiment, but we don't know exactly how to separate the prepared circular template. Thanks to Prof. Akkaya for helping us solve this problem.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Prof. Dongsheng Liu</strong><br>
          For DNA hydrogels, we know very little about it, so we asked experts in this field for help. Prof. Liu provided us with a variety of methods to detect the degree of hydrogel formation.

            <p>
                As a team from China, it is a great cost to travel to Boston and participate in this yearâ€™s iGEM, however, we are fortunate enough to have three generous sponsors. We are grateful to Dalian University of Technology, especially to School of Bioengineeering, International Office, School of Innovation and Enterpreneurship, Alumni Association of DUT, also to Fengmuyuan Technology Co., Ltd. (Dalian, China) and Baoxing Bio-Equipment Engineering Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) for supporting us financially.
