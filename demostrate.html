      <h4>The combination of cells and EpCAM aptamer</h4>
      In order to capture circulating tumor cells (CTCs) specifically, we choose
      the aptamer named SYL3C, which specifically combines with the EpCAM
      receptor overexpressing on the tumor cell membrane. After each end of the
      three kinds of aptamer is attached to a fluorescent radical group, we
      begin to verify whether the aptamer could bind to cells specifically. We
      choose two types of cells: Hela cells with no EpCAM expression and MCF-7
      cells with high EpCAM expression. Observation was performed under an
      inverted fluorescence microscope and as the figures shown below
      illustrated that Hela cells had no fluorescence, which means, HeLa cells
      did not bind to any of the three aptamers; MCF-7 cells, however, had a
      better binding effect on aptamer 1 and 3, but an inferior binding effect
      on aptamer 2.

      <h4>The Formation of DNA Hydrogel Without Cells</h4>
      <p>
        1. The formation of circular template In order to examine the successful
        preparation of the circular template, different samples were
        characterized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) as shown in
        Fig. 3, ligation products of ssDNA (Lane 2) exhibited a series of
        dispersive bands with slower migration than that of ssDNA (Lane 1),
        indicating the formation of circular templates and other byproducts.
        After the ligation products were treated with Exo I and Exo III, only
        one bright and well-defined band still existed, proving the complete
        digestion of ligation byproducts and successful preparation of the
        circular template (Lane 3).

        2. The formation of DNA Hydrogel For the
        next we carried out the hydrogel formation experiments with the prepared
        circular template, and the formation of hydrogen was confirmed by the
        following experiments. (a) Agarose Gel Electrophoresis Agarose gel
        electrophoresis was used to evaluate the formation of DNA hydrogel. DNA
        hydrogel is difficult to migrate through the agarose gel and remain in
        home position.

        (b) SEM Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to
        obtain the morphology of the DNA hydrogel. As shown in Figure 4, a large
        number of hydrogel particles with a diameter of about 2 Î¼m are observed
        in the buffer, which indicates the hydrogel has actually formed.

        (c) DLS
        Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis is used to get the size of the
        DNA hydrogel. As shown in Figure 5, the size of hydrogel particles is
        between 100 nm and 3000 nm.

        (d) Observation For the next we centrifuged
        the sample at 14000rpm for 10min. As shown in Figure 6 that significant
        volume of hydrogel is formed.

      <h4>The Formation of DNA Hydrogel With Cells</h4>
      <p>
        To verify the success of our design for cell-specific initiation of
        hydrogel formation, we performed the following experiment. First, we use
        GelRed, which is a red dye that only dyes DNA while does not dye living
        cells. To verify this, we stained HeLa and MCF-7 cells directly with
        GelRed. The results showed that neither type of the cell was stained.<br />

        <div class="img-comment">Figure 8. GelRed performed in living cells</div>
        After demonstrating that the aptamer successfully binds to EpCAM
        positive cells without binding to negative cells, we want to form the
        DNA hydrogel around the cells. The designed hydrogel-forming system was
        added, and after 8 hours , it was stained with GelRed. Under an inverted
        fluorescence microscope, it was observed that a hydrogel was formed
        around the MCF-7 cells with Aptamer 1 and Aptamer-Linker-Inhibitor-H1,
        which meant that the system we designed to initiate hydrogels by
        combining cells with aptamers was successful.
