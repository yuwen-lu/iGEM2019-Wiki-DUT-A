        Cancer, now the leading cause of human death, is hard to discover,
        control and cure. The circulating tumor cells (CTCs) circulate via
        normal vessels and capillaries formed through tumor-induced
        angiogenesis. They are very small in number, hidden in the blood cells,
        waiting for opportunities to invade tissues like surreptitious snakes
        seeking chances to bite. These cells may cause serious risks to human
        health, especially to patients. However, they are the outposts for tumor
        development and metastasis. Can we arrest these “bad guys” and let them
        to become our undercovers to reveal earlier the development trend of
        tumors? How can we arrest them?
        <br /><br />
        Yes, in this project, our preys are the CTCs.

          CTCs?
        </h4>
        <p>
          CTCs occur early during the formation and growth of a primary tumor
          (e.g. breast, colon, or prostate cancer), cells shed from the primary
          tumor and then circulate through the bloodstream. CTCs are essential
          to cancer metastasis, may create new tumors in different tissues or
          organs. Typically, an elevation in CTCs at any time during clinical
          treatment of cancers is an indicator of cancer progression. Due to the
          necessity of the CTCs in tumor metastasis, the detecting, capturing
          and isolation the CTCs can be a meaningful work both for clinical and
          research purposes.

          CTCs are more valuable because they are promising candidates for
          detection and further study of tumor cells.

          <img class="icon" src="./resources/icons/inspiration.png" alt="" />How
          to capture living CTCs?
        </h4>
        <p>
          CTCs are very rare and admixed with a very large number of
          erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets in blood, making their
          isolation, capture, and detection a major technological challenge. In
          order to discover and capture living CTCs, we come to an idea: We are
          going to construct a DNA hydrogel cage for CTCs, which can recognize
          the CTCs, light up the CTCs, and coat the CTCs by auto-assemble
          hydrogels around the cells. Hydrogels are very soft materials and can
          exhibit large volume changes, thus are promising encapsulation
          materials to maintain long-term viability of the CTCs.
