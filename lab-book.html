          <h4>            1. Hybridization the circular template the primer:
            </h4>
          Add 160ul of Aptamer-Primer 1 (200nm) annealing 5 min at 95℃ and cool to 20℃. Then add it to 7 wells, each well for 20ul, in turn marked A, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3, D. Add 20ul circular template, 80ul TE buffer per well, mix and incubate them at room temperature for 2 hours. 
          <h4>2. The R-Process</h4>
          Add 100ul of reaction buffer to A, B1, B2, B3, D, 50ul reaction buffer in C1, C2, C3, and 50ul of reaction buffer in C1, C2, C3; then add 50ul of dNTP(25mM) per well except A, add 0.5 ul of φ29 per well except D, then incubate at room temperature.
          <h4>3. The M-Process</h4>
             After incubating 40min, add 1ul of primer 2 and 3 to the well A, B1, C1, D , 1ul, and put in the thermostat to continue incubate. After 80min, add 1 ul of primer 2 and 3 to the well B2, C2 ,then put in the thermostat to continue incubate. After 120min, add 1 ul of primer 2 and 3 to the well B3, C3, then put in the thermostat to continue incubate.
          <br><h4>Result:</h4>
          We use the enzyme-labeled instrument to test the absorbance of the sample to observe the formation of hydrogels. However, it was found that there was no excessive change in the absorbent value, so it is not feasible to observe hydrogel formation in real time using the enzyme-labeled instrument.

          <h4>Hydrogels observation 1:</h4>
          There is no obvious phenomenon in tube A; tube B is more turbid than A, gels were too sticky so they were pulled out as silk when we are pipetting them; tube C is more turbid than A, which is not as good as B and the gel were also sticky.
          <h4>Analysis:</h4>
          (1)	The addition of TE solution is a necessary condition for hydrogel formation.<br>
          (2)	On the basis of the same sample volume, the homemade phi29 buffer is better for this capacity system.
          <h4>Hydrogels observation 2:</h4>
            Formulated 3% agaric gel for electrophoresis, added the circular template, products of tube A, tube B and tube C to the sample port respectively.
          <h4>Result:</h4>
          There was no phenomenon in the hole which added circular template, and gels were difficult to migrate through the agarose gel and remained the retention in home position for the remaining three holes.
