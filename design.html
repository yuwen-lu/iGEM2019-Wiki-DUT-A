      In our project, we designed a triggering mechanism based on cell receptor
      specific combination and introduce the circular template on the cell
      membrane by using specific targets in order to assemble hydrogel by
      rolling circular amplification hydrogel around the cell and capture the
      cell.<br />

      Aiming at generating hydrogel in a constant system from a single raw
      material and with a high degree of crosslinking, we utilized and developed
      the combination of rolling circular amplification (RCA) and
      multiple-primer chain amplification (MCA). They were carried out as
      follows: firstly, a circular template was produced and added with primer
      P1 corresponding to it. Phi29 DNA polymerase and dNTPs were used as raw
      materials for RCA, so as to obtain a long ssDNA chain with periodic
      circular template complementary sequence. Control the time of this stage
      (RCA), and then add primer P2 corresponding to the ssDNA long chain and
      another kind of primer P3 corresponding to the original cyclic template
      sequence into the system. In this stage, phi29DNA polymerase finished
      amplifying a cycle with all these three kinds of primers.<br />

      Although the primer sequences were different, periodically amplifying the
      sequence accesses that the roles of template chain and complementary chain
      were continuously exchanged in the amplification, so as to complete the
      generation of a large amount of ssDNA in a limited volume. These ssDNA
      strands, which is in a large amount, continue to fold and weave, forming
      nests of DNA monomers that pile up to assemble the hydrogel we need. This
      design allows the formation of hydrogel in an environment where the
      process is always mild and the activity of the enzyme can be maintained
      for a certain period of time, so the strength and cross-linking degree of
      the gel can be guaranteed in the cellular environment. Moreover, the raw
      material is simple and we can control the length of RCA time to manipulate
      the number of the periodic binds then control the crosslinking degree of
      the hydrogel.<br /><br />
      In this method, the preparation of single stranded circular DNA template
      is the focus of the whole system process. We used a general circular DNA
      preparation method to synthesize chain shaped linear DNA from known
      circular DNA template sequences, and designed end of the linear DNA as
      complementary fragments of P3, which can be combined to form all
      complementary sequences of P3. In preparation, we added the designed
      linear long strand DNA and P3 to the system at the same time,
      theoretically forming a linear DNA that is complementary to P3 end to end
      in the system. At this time, linear DNA transfers into the circular DNA
      with a nick and part of it is basepaired. Next, T4 DNA ligase is added to
      the system to fill the nick, and Exo I/III exonuclease is added to remove
      P3 basepaired by the outer end of the circular template, so as to produce
      circular template.<br />

      It is worth mentioning that this method based on ssDNA coiling and folding
      rather than constructing by whole base complementary, which enables us to
      make the gelling system work better on the cell surface without gelling
      off or misassembling. In that case, we need specific bind between this
      system and our target cell so our next goal is to introduce the template
      on the cell surface. As for CTCs, we hope that capsulated cells can be
      used for living cells detection and research. Therefore, instead of the
      antigen and antibody molecular targets, we adopted the method of aptamer
      binding.<br /><br />
      EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule) was first found in colon cancer
      as a single transmembrane protein, which is involved in the regulation of
      cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. EpCAM abnormally
      expressed in tumor cells and expressed 100 times higher than normal level
      in primary breast cancer tissues, 810 times higher than normal level in
      lymph node metastasis. EpCAM was selected as the target to combine the
      circular template with the cell membrane through aptamer binding. We
      screened an EpCAM adaptor named SYL3C from the paper database and verified
      its binding activity.<br /><br />
      Our project aims at capturing CTCs with DNA hydrogel and it is in need of
      the spcical initiation mechanism. This case is districted with two
      elementsï¼šFirstly, an aptamer sequence which specifically recognizes
      receptors on the membrane of circulating tumor cells and we choose the
      EpCAM which is mentioned above as the molecular target. Secondly, special
      inhabitor design which enables hydrogel to be specifically triggered by
      receptors on the cell membrane and assemble around CTCs. We mainly
      designed two triggering processes for hydrogel self-assembling.<br /><br />
      The first design is based on the conformational transformation with
      hairpin structure. In terms of molecule level, our design includes three
      parts: aptamer sequence, linker sequence and primer sequence. At the 5'
      end of the aptamer, we attached the FAM fluorescent radical group for
      labeling the aptamer binding to the cell surface, and at the 3' end of the
      appalatant sequence we sequentially attached the linker and primer
      sequences. The aptamer and primer are partially complementary to each
      other and that makes the primer sequences silent in the absence of cells.
      When the cell binds to the adaptor, it competitively opens the
      complementary pairing between the primer sequence and the adaptor,
      exposing the primer sequence to participate in the formation of hydrogel.
      In this case, we selected 9 base complementary pairs and 10 base
      complementary pairs through modeling, and we named them as aptamer 1 and
      aptamer 2 respectively.<br /><br />

      />
      The second design is linear ssDNA habitor shedding. Structurally, our
      design consists of three parts. The first part is the aptamer-linker
      sequence with a Linker sequence with a length of 23nt. The second part is
      the inhabitr used to mask the adaptor and linker. The third part is the
      stem-loop structure containing the primer, named H1. Among them, the
      inhabitor can mask the adaptor and linker sequence in the absence of
      cells. When the adaptor binds to the cell, the inhabitor will be competed
      off to expose linker. As for the H1, the 5 'end of the stem-loop sequence
      is the complementary Linker sequence. In order to make the Linker sequence
      in the first part open the stem-loop structure, we designed that the Gibbs
      free energy of the complementary pairing between Linker and stem-loop
      sequence is less than that of the stem-loop structure. The 3 'end of the
      stem-loop sequence is the primer for rolling circular amplification, and
      the 3' end of the Linker is the adaptor that connects the FAM fluorescent
      group, enabling us to detect whether the adaptor binds to the cell.
      <br /><br />

        class="content-img"
      />
      In the process of interaction with circulating tumor cells, the aptamer
      sequence in the first part specifically binds to circulating tumor cells,
      making the masking sequence fall off and the Linker sequence expose. The
      Linker is complementary to the entire segment of the hairpin structure,
      which opens the stem loop structure to expose the primer and binds to the
      circular template to initiate hydrogel formation.
