      <h3>Outline</h3>
      <br />

      In our project, we designed a triggering mechanism based on specific
      combination of the circular template and specific targets on the cell
      membrane in order to assemble DNA hydrogel by rolling circle amplification
      (RCA, or <strong>R</strong>) and multi-primed chain amplification (MCA, or
      <strong>M</strong>) around the cell.<br />

      <h3>Hydrogel self-assembling</h3>
      <br /><br />
      Aiming at generating hydrogel in a constant system from a single raw
      material and with a high degree of crosslinking, we utilized and developed
      the combination of rolling circle amplification (RCA) and multi-primed
      chain amplification (MCA). They were carried out as follows:
      <br />Firstly, a circular template was prepared and added with primer
      1(P1) corresponding to it. Phi29 DNA polymerase and dNTPs were used as raw
      materials for RCA, so as to obtain a long ssDNA chain with periodic
      circular template complementary sequence. Control the time of this stage
      (RCA), and then add primer 2(P2) corresponding to the ssDNA long chain and
      primer 3(P3) corresponding to the original circular template for a
      different site into the system to carry out MCA. In this stage (MCA),
      phi29DNA polymerase finished amplifying a cycle with all these three kinds
      of primers.

        different primer.

      Although the kinds of primer were different, periodically amplifying the
      sequence accesses that the roles of template chain and complementary chain
      were continuously exchanged in the amplification, so as to complete the
      generation of a large amount of ssDNA in a limited volume. These ssDNA
      strands, which are in a large amount, continued to fold and weave, forming
      nests of DNA monomers that pile up to assemble the hydrogel we need.
      <br /><br />

      This design allows the formation of hydrogel in an environment where the
      process is always mild and the activity of the enzyme can be maintained
      for a certain period of time. Moreover, the raw material is simple and we
      can control the time of both RCA and MCA to manipulate the size and
      crosslinking degree of the hydrogel.

      <h4>The preparation of the circular template</h4>
      <br />
      In this method, the preparation of single stranded circular DNA template
      is the focus of the whole system process. We used a general circular DNA
      preparation method to synthesize linear single strand DNA from known
      circular DNA template sequences, and designed both ends of the linear DNA
      as complementary fragments of P3, which can be combined to form all
      complementary sequences of P3. In the process of preparation, we added the
      designed linear single strand DNA and P3 to the system at the same time,
      theoretically forming a linear ssDNA that is complementary to P3 end to
      end in the system. At this time, linear single strand DNA transfered into
      the circular DNA with a nick and part of it is basepairing with P3. Next,
      T4 DNA ligase is added to the system to fill up the nick, and Exo I/III
      exonuclease is added to digest and prepare the circular template
      successfully.

      <h3>The choose of the receptor and aptamer</h3>
      It is worth mentioning that this method based on ssDNA coiling and folding
      rather than constructing by whole base complementary, which enables us to
      make the gelling system work better on the cell surface without gelling
      off or misassembling. In that case, we need specific bind between this
      system and our target cell so our next goal is to transfer the template
      onto the cell surface. As for CTCs, we hope that capsulated cells can be
      used for living cells detection and research. Therefore, instead of the
      antigen and antibody molecular targets, we adopted the method of aptamer
      binding.<br />
      <br />
      EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule) was first found in colon cancer
      as a single transmembrane protein, which is involved in the regulation of
      cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. EpCAM abnormally
      expressed in tumor cells and expressed 100 times higher than normal level
      in primary breast cancer tissues, 810 times higher than normal level in
      lymph node metastasis. EpCAM was selected as the target to combine the
      circular template with the cell membrane through aptamer binding. We
      screened an EpCAM adaptor named SYL3C from the paper database and verified
      its binding activity.<br /><br />

      <h3>The design of the triggering mechanism</h3>
      <br />
      Our project aims at capturing CTCs with DNA hydrogel and it is in need of
      the spcical initiation mechanism. This case is districted with two
      elementsï¼šFirstly, an aptamer which specifically recognizes receptors on
      the membrane of circulating tumor cells and we choose the EpCAM which is
      mentioned above as our molecular target . Secondly, special inhibitor
      designed by model which enables hydrogel to be specifically triggered by
      receptors on the cell membrane and assemble around CTCs. We mainly
      designed two triggering processes for hydrogel self-assembling.<br /><br />
      The first design is based on the conformational transformation with
      hairpin structure. In terms of molecule level, our design includes three
      parts: aptamer, linker and primer. At the 5' end of the aptamer, we
      attached the FAM fluorescent radical group for labeling the aptamer
      binding to the cell surface, and at the 3' end of the aptamer we
      sequentially attached the linker and primer. The aptamer and primer are
      partially complementary to each other and that makes the primer silent in
      the absence of cells with EpCAM. When the cell binds to the aptamer, it
      competitively opens the complementary pairing between the primer and the
      aptamer, exposing the primer to participate in the formation of hydrogel.
      In this case, we selected 9 base complementary pairs and 10 base
      complementary pairs through modeling, and we named them as Aptamer 1 and
      Aptamer 2 respectively.<br />

      The second design is the inhibitor shedding. Structurally, our design
      consists of three parts. The first part is the aptamer-linker with a
      linker which has 23nt. The second part is the inhibitor used to mask the
      aptamer and linker. The third part is the stem-loop structure containing
      the primer, named H1. Among them, the inhibitor can mask the aptamer and
      linker in the absence of cells. When the aptamer binds to the cell, the
      inhibitor will be competed off to expose linker. As for the H1, the 5 'end
      of the stem-loop sequence is the complementary linker. In order to make
      the linker in the first part open the stem-loop structure, we designed
      that the Gibbs free energy of the complementary pairing between Linker and
      stem-loop sequence is less than that of the stem-loop structure. The 3
      'end of the stem-loop is the primer for rolling circular amplification.
