        It is well-known that cancer metastasis is the primary cause behind many
        cancer patients’ death. Tumor cells first intrude the tissues
        surrounding the primary cancer cells, then transfer or exudate to other
        distal tissues with the help of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) through
        blood circulation or lymphatic networks. The transfer and exudation, are
        exactly the main reasons behind cancerous lesions. Obviously, research
        on the capture, detection and elimination of CTCs plays a vital role in
        combating cancer. However, catching CTCs has never been easy. On the one
        hand, the cells’ scarce amount in a person’s body and its tiny size make
        it hard for us to detect them. On the other, the existing CTCs capture
        devices usually damage the cells, causing the loss of their integrity
        and activity, which sets barriers for future research. Therefore, it is
        a challenge to capture circulating tumor cells while keeping them intact
        and active. In order to do this, we decided to design a prison garb for
        CTCs to keep them in captivity and under protection. Our prison garb has
        the following characteristics:

          Aptamer——the hunter of our prison garb
        </h3>
        <p>
          The aptamers serve as targets for specific priming capture in our
          prison garb. Their o oligonucleotide sequences are substitutions for
          antibodies in therapeutic and diagnostic applications. The aptamers
          are stable under various circumstances and can be synthesized and
          highly purified in laboratories easily. Surprisingly, modifying
          aptamers seems not to affect their affinity to the target, thus we can
          decorate our prison garb with aptamers, the hunters, for the detection
          and capture of CTCs. We attempt to develop a mechanism which uses the
          binding of adapters with CTCs as a trigger, so that we can accurately
          control our capture.

        <h3>Quantum dots ——the alertor of our prison garb</h3>
        <p>
          Quantum dots (QDs), a kind of nanocrystals with core-shell structure
          which are attached to the garb, help us catch CTCs visually. Compared
          with conventional fluorescent dyes, they have narrow excitation and
          wide emission spectra. Meanwhile, the photostability and quantum yield
          of QDs are better than those of fluorescent dyes. So QDs have been
          applied more and more frequently in bioimaging and analysis. By
          combining magnetic quantum dots into the capture system, we realize
          directional lighting of captured CTC.

        <h3>
          DNA hydrogel ——the fetter of our prison grab
        </h3>
        <p>
          The hydrogel system presents how we guarantee the controllability of
          our prison garb. We want to make DNA hydrogel form around CTCs through
          specific structure DNA cross-linking so as to achieve the coating and
          protection of the CTCs. Taking it into consideration, the designed DNA
          hydrogels should be equipped with the following functions. Firstly,
          start cross-linking according to the signal of specific aptamers of
          CTCs to ensure the correctness of the captured cells. Secondly, be
          convenient for us to fill quantum dots into it in order to recognize
          fluorescent labeling and magnetic adsorption-based capture. Thirdly,
          it can be coated or released in a mild way to ensure the physiological
          activity of the coated CTCs.
