            <p>
              It is well-known that cancer metastasis is the primary cause behind many
              cancer patients’ death. Tumor cells first intrude the tissues surrounding
              the primary cancer cells, then transfer or exudate to other distal tissues
              with the help of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) through blood circulation
              or lymphatic networks. The transfer and exudation, are exactly the main
              reasons behind cancerous lesions. Obviously, research on the capture,
              detection and elimination of CTCs plays a vital role in combating cancer.
              However, catching CTCs has never been easy. On the one hand, the cells’
              scarce amount in a person’s body and its tiny size make it hard for us to
              detect them. On the other, the existing CTCs capture devices usually
              damage the cells, causing the loss of their integrity and activity, which
              sets barriers for future research. Therefore, it is a challenge to capture
              circulating tumor cells while keeping them intact and active. In order to
              do this, we decided to design a prison garb for CTCs to keep them in
              captivity and under protection. Our prison garb has the following
              characteristics:
            </p>
            <h4>
              Aptamer——the hunter of our prison garb
            </h4>
            <p>
              The aptamers serve as targets for specific priming capture in our prison
              garb. Their o oligonucleotide sequences are substitutions for antibodies
              in therapeutic and diagnostic applications. The aptamers are stable under
              various circumstances and can be synthesized and highly purified in
              laboratories easily. Surprisingly, modifying aptamers seems not to affect
              their affinity to the target, thus we can decorate our prison garb with
              aptamers, the hunters, for the detection and capture of CTCs. We attempt
              to develop a mechanism which uses the binding of adapters with CTCs as a
              trigger, so that we can accurately control our capture.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Quantum dots ——the alertor of our prison garb</h4>
            <p>
              Quantum dots (QDs), a kind of nanocrystals with core-shell structure which
              are attached to the garb, help us catch CTCs visually. Compared with
              conventional fluorescent dyes, they have narrow excitation and wide
              emission spectra. Meanwhile, the photostability and quantum yield of QDs
              are better than those of fluorescent dyes. So QDs have been applied more
              and more frequently in bioimaging and analysis. By combining magnetic
              quantum dots into the capture system, we realize directional lighting of
              captured CTC.
            </p>
            <h4>
              DNA hydrogel ——the fetter of our prison grab
            </h4>
            <p>
              The hydrogel system presents how we guarantee the controllability of our
              prison garb. We want to make DNA hydrogel form around CTCs through
              specific structure DNA cross-linking so as to achieve the coating and
              protection of the CTCs. Taking it into consideration, the designed DNA
              hydrogels should be equipped with the following functions. Firstly, start
              cross-linking according to the signal of specific aptamers of CTCs to
              ensure the correctness of the captured cells. Secondly, be convenient for
              us to fill quantum dots into it in order to recognize fluorescent labeling
              and magnetic adsorption-based capture. Thirdly, it can be coated or
              released in a mild way to ensure the physiological activity of the coated
              CTCs.
