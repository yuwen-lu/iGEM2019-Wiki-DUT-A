        </h3>
        <p>
          Our project aims to develop a DNA hydrogel system which can target,
          capture and isolate circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Once the DNA
          aptamers target the CTCs, it will trigger the rolling circle
          amplification (RCA, or R) followed by a multi-primed chain
          amplification (MCA, or M). The amplified DNA fragments will form a
          network of hydrogen to capture the CTCs. This structure enlarges the
          size of CTCs and help to separate them. Moreover, this separating
          process can be seen because of the fluorophore attached to the DNA
          template.

        </h3>
        <p>
          Team DUT China A attaches great importance to the safety and security
          of both scientists and the environment. Our host lab, Zi Laboratories,
          follows General requirements for laboratory biosafety in China.
          <br /><br />
          Although all the members involved in the experiment were trained
          strictly before thanks to their professional course, our professional
          experimental teachers still helped us to conduct systematic
          experimental safety training right before the lab work start. The
          consultant, who has extensive experience in genetic engineering and
          has been doing research on the circulating tumor cells for many years,
          helped us to understand the experimental procedures and attentions for
          the experiments relating to cells. Throughout the project, we reported
          the progress to our directors and got instructions from them every
          week.
          <br /><br />
          We strictly obey the rules of the laboratory practices and guidelines.
          All our reagents and instruments have their own fixed position,
          strictly comply with the drug label management regulations. Everyone
          doing the experiment should wear experimental gloves and safety
          goggles and do not take them out of the lab. We close UV light after
          sterilization of our clean bench and then perform operations under
          white light. Before performing the experiment operation around the
          flame lamp in the cleaning bench, we use the 75% alcohol spray to
          clean our hands and wait for them to be air-dried. Moreover, all the
          toxic reagents are used according to their instruction. Sharp objects
          such as broken glass are placed separately from other items. After the
          experiment is completed, we sterilize the experimental equipment and
          place the experimental in a special garbage bag and hand over to the
          biological waste professional processing company. All the methods
          above are to ensure the safety and security of the laboratory and to
          avoid the environmental pollution of the experimental organisms.

        Three cell lines including HeLa (Epithelial cell adhesion molecule
        negative, EpCAM-negative), MCF-7 (EpCAM-positive) and A431
        (EpCAM-positive) used I our project are commercialized and widely-used
        in research, without any pathogen. Our project is free of chassis due to
        our design. All the DNA aptamer and parts we used in our project are
        synthesized by credible biotech company. The ligase and other enzymes
        would be collected with other liquid waste and sterilized under the
        condition of 121.3℃, 103.4kPa for 20 minutes. What’s more, the organisms
        we used in our experiment would be deactivated following the standard
        procedure.
        <br /><br />
        The final aim of our project is to detect circulating tumor cells with
        human blood. However, we will not conduct any test with blood but take
        white cells to simulate real blood environment and carry out experiments
        under such conditions.
